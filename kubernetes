Kubernetes is an open source orchestration system for managing containerized applications across multiple hosts, providing basic mechanisms
for the deployment, maintenance, and scaling of applications.

Managing the containers @large scale across multiple hosts

Kubernetes supports Docker and Rocket containers. 

How is Kubernetes related to Docker?
Docker builds the containers and these containers communicate with each other via Kubernetes. So, containers running on multiple hosts
can be manually linked and orchestrated using Kubernetes like swarm

What is Container Orchestration?
Consider a scenario where you have 5-6 microservices for a single application performing various tasks. Now, these microservices are put 
in individual containers, but won’t be able to communicate without container orchestration like kubernetes or swarm.
container orchestration means all the services in individual containers working together to fulfill the needs of a single server.

application would have a cluster of containers running across multiple hosts, all these containers would need to talk to each other. So,
to do this you need something big that would load balance, scale & monitor the containers. kubernetes is best choice among others.

What is Minikube?
Minikube is a tool that makes it easy to run Kubernetes locally. This runs a single-node Kubernetes cluster inside a virtual machine.

Pod
A Pod is the smallest deployable unit that can be created, scheduled, and managed. It’s a logical collection of containers that belong to
an application.

What is Kubelet?
This is an agent service which runs on each node and enables the slave to communicate with the master. So, Kubelet works on the description
of containers provided to it in the PodSpec and makes sure that the containers described in the PodSpec are healthy and running.


Kubelet ensures that the containers defined in the Pods are started and continue running.
Q.how to define a containers in pod?


What is Kubectl?
Kubectl is the platform using which you can pass commands to the cluster. So, it basically provides the CLI to run commands against
the Kubernetes cluster with various ways to create and manage the Kubernetes component.
Kubctl CLI
kubectl is a command-line utility that controls the Kubernetes cluster. 
some of the important Kubectl commands listed below
kubectl create -f couchbase-pod.yml   - Create a Couchbase pod
kubectl create -f couchbase-rs.yml    - Create a Couchbase Replica Set
kubectl delete -f couchbase-pod.yml   - Deletes/Removes the Couchbase pod
kubectl get pods                      - List all the pods
kubectl describe pod couchbase-pod    - Describe the Couchbase pod
kubectl --help                        - Shows the complete list of available commands.

kubectl [command] [type] [name] [flags]
[command] - create, get, describe, delete, or scale.
[type]    - specifies the Kubernetes resource type like pod, service,replica set, node
[name]    - Specifies the name of the resource
