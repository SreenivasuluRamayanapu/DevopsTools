Jenkins is a continuous integration tool. we can do build automation and deployment automation
Jenkins is a build automation server as well we can do deployment automation also.

Developers do the changes and checkin their code to source code repository like Git, Jenkins server pull the code under workspace in 
Jenkins home directory, then it compile the code and run the test cases then it perform source code quality check, if everything goes well 
it creates package. If something goes wrong send email notifications to the developers, so that they can fix the isssue again they push to Git
this is how freequently integrate the code.

Once package is creted, automatically deploy it into the test servers for User Acceptance Test, then Finally, the application is manually
deployed on the production servers for release by taking an aprroval. So continuous dlivery is also a automated process except deploying the
application in to production based on approval.

continuous deployment is completely automated process right from developers check in their source code to Git to till deployment into the
production.
continuous deployment is risky if anything goes wrong in production it becomes messy.

Advantage of contnuous integration
1. immeadiate feedback to the developers about build result
2. detecting and fixing the bugs easier
3. it improves the productivity
4. it improves the code quality by minimizing the defects
