Kubernetes is an open source orchestration system for managing containerized applications across multiple hosts, providing basic mechanisms
for the deployment, maintenance, and scaling of applications.

Kubernetes supports Docker and Rocket containers. 

How is Kubernetes related to Docker?
Docker builds the containers and these containers communicate with each other via Kubernetes. So, containers running on multiple hosts
can be manually linked and orchestrated using Kubernetes like swarm

What is Container Orchestration?
Consider a scenario where you have 5-6 microservices for a single application performing various tasks. Now, these microservices are put 
in individual containers, but won’t be able to communicate without container orchestration like kubernetes or swarm.
container orchestration means all the services in individual containers working together to fulfill the needs of a single server.


application would have a cluster of containers running across multiple hosts, all these containers would need to talk to each other. So,
to do this you need something big that would load balance, scale & monitor the containers. kubernetes is best choice among others.

Pod
A Pod is the smallest deployable unit that can be created, scheduled, and managed. It’s a logical collection of containers that belong to
an application.

Kubelet ensures that the containers defined in the Pods are started and continue running.

Kubctl CLI
kubectl is a command-line utility that controls the Kubernetes cluster. 
some of the important Kubectl commands listed below
kubectl create -f couchbase-pod.yml   - Create a Couchbase pod
kubectl create -f couchbase-rs.yml    - Create a Couchbase Replica Set
kubectl delete -f couchbase-pod.yml   - Deletes/Removes the Couchbase pod
kubectl get pods                      - List all the pods
kubectl describe pod couchbase-pod    - Describe the Couchbase pod
kubectl --help                        - Shows the complete list of available commands.

kubectl [command] [type] [name] [flags]
[command] - create, get, describe, delete, or scale.
[type]    - specifies the Kubernetes resource type like pod, service,replica set, node
[name]    - Specifies the name of the resource
