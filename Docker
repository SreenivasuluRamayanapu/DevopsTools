The Application code what we have developed and along with all the dependencies required to run taht application, we can create it as 
an image(basically we are writing docker file) and push it to the Docker registry. So that we can pull the image and run it in any
environments using light weight isolated containers without any portability and compatibility issues.
            As the code travels from Developer's machine to production, there are many different environments it has to go through, to get
there.each of these environments may have minor differences, docker provides a consistent environment to the application from dev to
production, easying the code deployment.

containers utilizes minimal system resources like CPU, RAM etc... from HostOS(DockerHost), so that containers are light weight.

basically to deploy an application we have 3 different environments
    1. physical server
    2. Virtual machine
    3. container
